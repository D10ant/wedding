        The venue, Cambridge Cottage, is approximately 500 metres from the main
        entrance to Kew Gardens, Victoria Gate and is best accessed by walking
        around Kew Gardens as opposed to through it. If you fancy a stroll
        through the beautiful botanical gardens prior to the ceremony, our
        guests have free entry all day, so long as you give our name at the
        entrance. However, please leave at least 20 minutes walking time if you
        do choose to enter through the main gate.

      %p
        %strong By Car:
        We would strongly advise people to use public transport to attend our
        wedding, as there are no parking spaces available at Cambridge Cottage
        itself. There is some free parking from 10am on Kew Road (A307) as well
        as some spaces around Kew Green. Residential parking restrictions apply
        throughout the Kew area and spaces will be very limited owing to the fact
        that the gardens are a very popular tourist attraction and it will be
        during the busy school holiday period.

      %p
        The postal address for GPS is: Kew, Richmond, Surrey, TW9 3AB.
        The gardens are well sign posted and Cambridge Cottage is just off
        Kew Green, which is to the North East of the main entrance (Victoria
        Gate).
